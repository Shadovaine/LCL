   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ShadoVaine/LCL.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows)
- pipx (recommended) or pip

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using pipx (Recommended for users)

python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Install LCL
pipx install .
```

#### Option 2: Development installation with pip

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

1. **Bug Reports**: Found a bug? Please report it!
2. **Feature Requests**: Have an idea for a new command or feature?
3. **Code Contributions**: Fix bugs, add features, or improve documentation
4. **Documentation**: Help improve the docs, examples, or tutorials
5. **Command Additions**: Add new Linux commands to the library

### Adding New Commands

When adding a new Linux command:

1. Create a new file in the appropriate category directory
2. Follow the existing command structure:

   ```python
   from core.fields import CommandField
   from core.options import Option
   
   class YourCommand:
       name = "command_name"
       description = "Brief description of what the command does"
       
       options = [
           Option("-o", "--option", "Description of option"),
           # Add more options as needed
       ]
       
       examples = [
           "command_name --option value",
           "command_name -o value"
       ]
   ```

3. Add comprehensive examples and documentation
4. Include both basic and advanced usage examples

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format code with black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Check style with flake8
flake8 .
```

### Documentation

- All new commands must include:
  - Clear description
  - Usage examples
  - Parameter explanations
  - Common use cases

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=lcl

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_command_name.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new commands
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use descriptive test names

Example test structure:

```python
def test_command_basic_usage():
    """Test basic command functionality"""
    # Test implementation

def test_command_with_options():
    """Test command with various options"""
    # Test implementation

def test_command_error_handling():
    """Test command error handling"""
    # Test implementation
```
